Project Overview

This project develops a data-driven urban sustainability indexing and clustering framework that evaluates and groups global cities based on environmental, social, infrastructure, and climate resilience indicators. Using unsupervised machine learning and geospatial analytics, the model identifies sustainability performance clusters and maps global cities into comparable risk and development profiles.

The system supports smart city planning, ESG-based infrastructure financing, climate risk monitoring, and sustainable urban policy design by providing interpretable sustainability groupings and geospatial visualizations.

🧠 Key Objectives

Construct a composite Urban Sustainability Index (USI) using environmental, energy, housing, transport, pollution, and socio-economic indicators

Apply unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster cities into sustainability performance groups

Identify high-risk, moderate, and high-performing sustainability city clusters

Support policy targeting, infrastructure funding prioritization, and ESG risk scoring

⚙️ Methodology

Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Data Sources: Global city-level environmental, infrastructure, housing, transport, and climate datasets

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, GeoPandas, Folium, SQL

Visualization: Interactive geospatial mapping of sustainability clusters

📊 Outputs

Composite Urban Sustainability Index (USI) scores

City sustainability cluster assignments

Interactive sustainability maps highlighting cluster risk levels

Policy-relevant dashboards for urban development and ESG analysis

🏛️ Applications

Smart city and urban development planning

ESG and climate-risk investment analysis

Infrastructure funding prioritization

Environmental policy and sustainability benchmarking

Public-sector analytics and climate resilience research

🚀 Why This Matters

Urban areas account for over 70% of global emissions and infrastructure investment.
This project provides a scalable analytics framework for data-driven sustainability benchmarking and climate-resilient infrastructure planning, enabling governments, researchers, and ESG institutions to make informed development and financing decisions.
